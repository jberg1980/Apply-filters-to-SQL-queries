<h2>Summary </h2>
In this exercise I applied the following SQL queries to obtain certain information on employees computers. I used the log_in_attempts and employees tables. Then I used the AND, OR and NOT operators to filter the data for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.
